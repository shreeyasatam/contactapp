Designed, developed a responsive “Contacts” application that allows the user to browse their contacts
Made use of https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ (/users are the contacts)
I learned many interesting things by building this app. To begin with, I learned that styling the elements of a website with just plain CSS can get quite messy and you need to be really creative and organized to think of how to display table on webpage.
Second, I got to keep on honing my JS and React knowledge. I got better at designing the whole framework of the page, deciding where should the components be settled and how to pass props to them, used React Hooks ‘useState’, ‘useEffect’, ’Sync’, ‘Await’ to fetch data from API.

#Technologies used- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ReactJs, react Hooks
